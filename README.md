# This is the software for the Fairtone device, which is a programmable music machine capable of creating varied amounts of musical tones with varying degrees of distortion. The device itself can be plugged in to most electronic instruments. The cool thing about this software is that it controls the sequencer via a simple script written in the programming language, Melodium.
